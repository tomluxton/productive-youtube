# Productive Youtube

Productive Youtube is a chrome extension built to allow people ot be more productive with the free resources that are found on youtube. Currently the main feature is for thumbnails to be hidden from users, so learners are not tempted to click on them and be distracted.

## Getting Started

Make sure to have Google chrome installed on your computer. Go to chrome://extensions/ and enable Developer mode (found in the top right hand corner). 

### Installing

Pull the files of this github (except this read me). Click load unpacked in the extensions tab and upload the files. This should get the extension running on your Chrome.
